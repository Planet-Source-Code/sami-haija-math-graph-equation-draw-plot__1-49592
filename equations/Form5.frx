ÿ”***	Supported Functions:
	Sin(EQUATION),Cos(EQUATION),Tan(EQUATION)
	Log(EQUATION)
	Use ^ for power
	you can't use 2x or 4x u must use 2*x,4*x instead



1.	You will write the equation without the "Y="
	Ex: x-1
	You can separate more than one equations using the comma ","



2.	You can zoom inside the equation using the X-Scale & Y-Scale
	The X-Scale for the horizontal axis, the Y is for the vertical



3.	You can also specify the accuracy (X-step) for drawing the equations
	1 is optimum for linear equations
	0.1 for Complex Equations Ex: Sin(X^2)



4.	You can use the prescale to modify the scale and the X-step automatically
